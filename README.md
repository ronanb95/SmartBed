# SmartBed
This application is designed to monitor the sleeping patterns of the elderly in order to provide peace of mind with as little invasiveness as possible.

The application in it's current form is simply a proof of concept. It uses a Raspberry Pi with an attached load sensor that represents the sensor(s) that would be placed in the individuals bed.

By consistently monitoring the weight placed on this sensor throughout the day / night we can imitate a users sleep patterns and collect the data surrounding this. This data is then analysed in order to allow us to form a detailed understanding on the users habits. We can then continue to monitor the users sleep patterns and alert the registered users if any abnormal activity occurs.
